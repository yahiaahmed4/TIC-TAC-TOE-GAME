# TIC-TAC-TOE-GAME
Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe game repository! This simple yet classic game allows players to engage in a battle of wits on the familiar 3x3 grid. The game features two modes: Player vs Player and Player vs Computer.

# Modes
# Player vs Player
In this mode, two human players take turns marking spaces on the grid. The first player to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. If all spaces on the grid are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

# Player vs Computer
In this mode, you can challenge the computer to a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. You will play as 'X' and the computer as 'O'. The game is designed with varying levels of difficulty, providing a challenge for players of all skill levels. Try to outsmart the computer and emerge victorious!
